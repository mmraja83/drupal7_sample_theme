# This is simple module for beginners and learners.

Welcome to the drupal7_sample_theme wiki!

I have created this Drupal7 basic sample theme for beginners and learners. It is not full-fledged one, but hoping this will be the good starting point for beginners. This explains DB Querying, Theme view etc.,

Logic: It will check the User table for the row count. If the row count is Odd, it will just print the message. Otherwise It will list user details by joining the User role table. So you can learn how to do query, Join query and how to output using "theme" method.

Output view for this module:
